## Repository to demo Trivy

This repository provides several examples, showcasing Trivy. Trivy is an open source security scanner.

## Trivy CLI

Installation options: https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/getting-started/installation/

Below are some of the commands that can be used through the Trivy CLI.

### Vulnerability Scans

Scan a container image for vulnerabilities:
```
trivy i ubuntu:20.04
```

Scan a container image for vulnerabilities but ignore all vulnerabilities that do not have a fix available:
```
trivy i --ignore-unfixed ubuntu:20.04
```

Scan a container image for vulnerabilities but filter for HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities
```
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --vuln-type os postgres:10.6
```

Scan any GH repository for vulnerabilities:
```
trivy repo --vuln-type library https://github.com/raesene/sycamore
```

Scan any filesystem for vulnerabilities:
```
git clone https://github.com/raesene/sycamore
trivy fs ./sycamore/
```

### Misconfiguration Scans

Scan all of your infrastructure configuration for vulnerabilities:
```
ls trivy-demo/bad_iac
```

Scan your Dockerfile for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations:
```
trivy config trivy-demo/bad_iac/docker/
```

Scan your Kubernetes manifests for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations:
```
trivy config trivy-demo/bad_iac/kubernetes
```

Scan your Terraform for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations:
```
trivy config trivy-demo/bad_iac/terraform
```

### Custom Policies

Trivy makes it possible to scan custom policies defined in Rego.

Note that if Rego is not your cup of tea and you are focusing on Terraform scans, you can specify custom policies in JSON and YAML format in tfsec.

The following file provides a custom polocy that compares a Kubernetes deployment and a Kubernetes service. It then scans them to see whether they have the same selectors applied:
```
cat custom-policies/combine-yaml.rego
```

The following command will run the scan:
```
trivy conf --severity CRITICAL --policy ./custom-policies/combine-yaml.rego --namespaces user ./manifests
```

### Scan your connected Kubernetes cluster

The Trivy Kubernetes command scans any connected Kubernetes cluster for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, exposed secrets and more.

To scan your entire cluster and receive a summary report use the following command:

```
trivy k8s --report summary cluster
```

To scan a specific namespace in your cluster and receive a summary report use the following command:
```
trivy k8s --n kube-system --report summary cluster
```

To receive a detailed report, you can use the `--report=all` flag. However, we would advice to only do that on specific namespaces or resources since you will be provided with a lot of detailed information:
```
trivy k8s --n kube-system --report all cluster
```

Similar to vulnerabilities, we can also filter in-cluster for specific vulnerabilty types:
```
trivy k8s --severity=CRITICAL --report all cluster
```

With the trivy K8s command, you can also scan specific workloads that are running within your cluster:
```
trivy k8s -–n default --report summary cluster deployments/react-application
```
or
```
trivy k8s –-n app --report summary cluster deployments/react-application
```

## Trivy Operator

While you would use the Trivy CLI on your local machine or from within a CI/CD pipeline, the Trivy operator is installed inside your Kubernetes cluster. From there, it performs continuous scanning of your Kuberentes resources.
Have a look at the documentation for more information:

Installation options: https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-operator/v0.0.8/

### Scan your connected Kubernetes cluster

Once the operator is installed, you will see it running in the Trivy System namespace:
```
kubectl get all -n trivy-system
```

Now, we can install a deployment. If you do not have a deployment within your cluster, you can use our example application:
```
kubectl apply -f manifests 
```

Trivy will then automatically scan new deployments:
```
kubectl get Vulnerabilityreports
```

To get detailed information on the vulnerabilities, describe the Vulnerabilityreports:
```
kubectl describe Vulnerabilityreports replicaset-react-application-79694589b9-react-application
```

## Trivy Config

The Trivy Config allows us to define the configurations for our security scans in a YAML manifest. An example is provided in this repository within [./trivy-config.yaml](./trivy-config.yaml)

You can then use the config manifest in your security scans such as your image vulnerability scans:

```
trivy image --severity HIGH node:14
```
